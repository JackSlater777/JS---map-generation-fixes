This mod fixes all major bugs that occur when generating a random map.

In addition to this, the mod provides 3 templates:
- Jebus Cross (XL) - a modified Jebus Cross template based on HotA, in which map generation starts from the center, not the player's zone
- Ring (XL+U) - based on the old Ring template. The main difference is the presence of guards between the zones
- Ring Giant (G+U) - the same as the previous one, only designed for playing with the XXL mod
